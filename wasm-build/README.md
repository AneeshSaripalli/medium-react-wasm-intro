# WASM Build Directory
## What is this?
`wasm-build` is the folder generated by building the Rust source in [/wasm](/wasm). This folder usually should be in the `.gitignore` for the repository because it's generated rather than a source. I left this in for clarity & for anyone who wants to skip the Rust part of the tutorial.

## How is this generated?
You can generate this Webassembly by running the [`/wasm/BUILD`](/wasm/BUILD) file while in the [`/wasm`](/wasm) directory. You may need to run `chmod +x BUILD` (enable file execution) before being able to run it.
