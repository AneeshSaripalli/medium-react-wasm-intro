# React Client

## What is this?
This is the source and config for the React client. It's essentially an ejected Create React App template. We made some changes to [App.tsx](/react-client/src/App.tsx) to demonstrate an interface to our generated Webassembly.

## Development
Running `npm start` or `npm run start` will boot up the development mode server. This supports live reload & debug without having to restart the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
